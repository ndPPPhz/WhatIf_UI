# What If 
Stop blaming bad luck for your fantasy football failures.

## What is What If?

Well, I am, as well as most of my friends, a football addicted and a fantasy football player.

In fantasy football, you build your fantasy football team via the draft. 

You and your friends start with the same coins budget that you will use for buying players. The players' real-time stats are converted into fantasy points by your league provider.

There are many type of competitions in fantasy football but one of the most used one is that each week you challenge another team and the fantasy team that scores the most points wins the game and gets 3 points.

As you can imagine, the calendar plays a prime role because you might end up doing a lot a points and challenge someone else who made more points than you ( and unfortunately lose ) whereas other opponents ( that you could have encountered if the sorted calendar was different ) scored less than you ( hence you would have won ).

A day I got fed up of all the excuses my friends have been doing like: 
"I am so unlucky. If the calendar was different I could have been first in the rank"
that I decided to build from scratch this funny tool/website.

In a nutshell, it fetches all the weeks all the fantasy points that each team has collected and it generates a random calendar.
Based on that calendar, a new rank will be calculated and shown.

For generating random calendars I have used my [fixtures-generator](https://github.com/ndPPPhz/Fixture-Generator) **node.js** tool.

The backend instead, is built using node.js along with **express.js**.
